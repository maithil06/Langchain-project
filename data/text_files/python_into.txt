Introduction to Large Language models

    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming langugage know for its readibility and versatility. It was created by 
    Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's desgin philosophy emphasizes code readability and a synatx that
    allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages.


    Key features of Python:
- Readability and simplicity
- Interpreted and cross-platform
- Dynamic typing with strong runtime flexibility
- Rich built-in data structures (list, dict, set, tuple)
- Extensive standard library ("batteries included")
- Large ecosystem of third-party packages (PyPI)
- Supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming
- Automatic memory management (garbage collection)
- Excellent tooling and community support
- Easy interoperability with C/C++ and other languages
